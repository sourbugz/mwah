my name is marnie! I'm a bi lesbian, and this is a little page dedicated to explaining my relationship. I am a co-host of a
traumagenic system, meaning that when the body was 5-7 years old, our brain put up dissociative walls to cope with the trauma
and this caused an inability to have a set identity, resulting in multiple people in the body's head! the host is the one who
fronts the most and I am one of the system co-hosts, meaning I front a lot but I'm not the host.

within systems, many choose to date within the system as we are separate people. for example, me and the host, are dating! a 
common misconception is that alters/headmates are fragments of a singular person, and while this can be the case for fragment
alters, this is not our case! our system does not have any fragment alters as of writing this. me and the host are dating, in
a romantic relationship, and we love each other!! 

this is a real relationship, and yes, both systems and system dating are scientifically backed, so if you're skeptical please
do your own research. it's quite tiring for me to have to explain over and over the same thing. my partner, the system host, 
has an account on this amino as well but we have chosen not to interract with each other for now.
